# College Kings 2 Translation Files

## Tutorials

### How to start translating a new part:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the GitHub repository to your PC.
3. Find your language folder. If your language doesn't exist copy the `copy-me` folder and rename it accordingly.
4. Open a file and start translating:
```py
# game/script.rpy:95
translate piglatin start_636ae3f5:

    # e "Thank you for taking a look at the Ren'Py translation framework."
    e "Thank you for taking a look at the Ren'Py translation framework."
```
- The line starting with `#` is the English sentence
- The line starting with `e` is what you need to replace with the translated sentence

```py
translate piglatin strings:

    old "Eileen"
    new "Eileen"
  ```
- The line starting with `old` is the English sentence
- The line starting with `new` is what you need to replace with the translated sentence

### How to change the language of the game:
1. Create a filename.rpy file inside the "game" folder (your_path_here\College Kings 2\game\)
2. include the following code (change the language name depending on what language you are attempting to use):
```
init python:
     config.language = "espanol"
```
3. Start a new game (or load a save that had already started in the chosen language)
4. Enjoy!

### How to add a newly translated part:
1. Make sure your commits and edits are pushed to your forked repository.
2. Create a Pull Request to be reviewed and merged.

Have fun!
