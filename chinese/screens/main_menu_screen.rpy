    old "College Kings 2 is an episodic game, where each episode builds on the previous one. Whilst you are able to play Episode 3 via the path builder, you may experience bugs, glitches and other issues and saves are unlikely to work at all. To get the most out of Episode 3 and experience the story in full, we therefore highly recommend you install and play Episode 2 before jumping into Episode 3."
